# Lap-time-Nurburgring

In this project I have analysed the lap timing of road legal sport cars that have recorded their lap time in nurburgring. With the help of various mechanical features I created a prediction model that uses tensor flow and can predict the potential lap time of any vehicle on that track

# Mechanical features used
1. Engine capacity
2. Engine type
3. Charger type(turbo or super)
4. HP
5. Torque
6. Top Speed
